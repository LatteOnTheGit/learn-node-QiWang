- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

whole thing is a callback, 
execution order is
file
I was scheduled to run immediately
5ms have passed since I was scheduled

read file is in poll, '`${delay}ms have passed since I was scheduled' is in the timers
and 'I was scheduled to run immediately' is in pending.
after main thread end, pending process get execute, after timeout is end, delayed process get execute.

changed timeout will not change, because setImmediate get executed immediately in the queue
